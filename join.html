                <p class="text-center">Interested in joining us? We have two types of vendors: Daily vendors and lease holders. We invite anyone interested in
                vending to read through our <a href="pdf/2019 VENDOR HANDBOOK.pdf" target="_blank">vendor handbook</a>.
                <br>
                <b>Daily Vendors</b> are always welcome! It's a great way to try out our market and learn what vending
                is all about without a seasonal commitment.
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>We only accept new vendors who produce what they sell, with a strong preference for
                    farmers. Please specify if you are a community group, charity or fundraiser.</li>
                    <li>Please fill out our <a href="pdf/BellevilleFarmersMarketApplication2019.pdf" target="_blank">Farmers’ Market Vendor Application</a>.</li>
                    <li>Any vendors of prepared foods or serving food must have prior approval from the Health Unit. Start by filling out their
                    <a href="pdf/Food Vendor Notification (Feb 2019).pdf"target="_blank">Food Vendor Notification</a>.</li>
                    <li>We always try to make room for daily vendors, and although summertime Saturdays can be
                    tricky there's usually room on Tuesdays or Thursdays.</li>
                    <li>Your fee will be $30/day for a stall, and after you have paid $185 total, you will no longer
                    be required to pay daily fees each time you vend in the remainder of the calendar year.
                    You will also be paid up as a member of the Belleville Farmers Market Association for the
                    year.</li>
